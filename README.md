# Flattener
Code sample (array flattener in Perl)

Edit: Sorry, [also available as a gist](https://gist.github.com/IBwWG/c730fd4a9bc9eb13bac7273f4ac3cef8), in case that makes a difference.

For simplicity given the scope of the sample, tests and the function being tested are all kept in one file.

To run the tests simply call perl with `flatten.pl` as its argument.  Results should be similar to:

```sh
$ perl flatten.pl 
1..4
# Running under perl version 5.022001 for linux

# Using Test.pm version 1.26
ok 1

```
